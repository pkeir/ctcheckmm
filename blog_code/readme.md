This code was created to ensure the code presented in the accompanying blog
post compiles. There, the presentation was for a small main.cpp file, which
includes the larger verification code as a header library (ctcheckmm.hpp).
Together the pair are essentially the same as ctcheckmm.cpp in the parent
directory.

The standalone ctcheckmm.cpp is the reference version which should be used for
benchmarking or further development.
