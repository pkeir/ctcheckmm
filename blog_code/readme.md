This code was created to ensure the code presented in the accompanying blog
post compiles. There, the presentation was for a small main.cpp file, which
includes the larger verification code as a header library (ctcheckmm-cest.hpp).
Together the pair are essentially the same as ctcheckmm-cest.cpp in the parent
directory.

The standalone ctcheckmm-cest.cpp was the reference version at the time of the
blog post, but ctcheckmm-std.cpp is the main version now; improved by
the 2024 simplification of using the std namespace throughout; through the
C'est 2 fork of libstdc++.
